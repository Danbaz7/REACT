# React Project

A modern React application built for learning and demonstrating essential React concepts, including components, props, state, and JSX. The project is organized for clarity, scalability, and ease of experimentation.

## 📚 Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** All UI elements are built as reusable React components.
- **Dynamic Content:** Core concepts and examples are rendered dynamically using props and state.
- **Interactive Tabs:** Example section uses tab buttons to switch between React topics, powered by React hooks.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Components and data are organized in dedicated folders for maintainability.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

## 📖 Learning Objectives

- Understand React component structure and composition
- Learn how to pass and use props
- Manage state with hooks (`useState`)
- Use JSX for dynamic UI rendering
- Organize code for scalability and maintainability
